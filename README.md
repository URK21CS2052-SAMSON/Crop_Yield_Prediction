Crop Yield Prediction using Decision Tree Regression
This project involves predicting crop yields using machine learning, specifically employing decision tree regression. By analyzing historical data, the model aims to provide accurate predictions that can assist in agricultural planning and decision-making.

Project Overview
Crop yield prediction is crucial for optimizing agricultural productivity and ensuring food security. This project leverages decision tree regression to predict crop yields based on various factors such as rainfall, area under cultivation, and other relevant agricultural data.

Data Preparation
The dataset used in this project includes historical data on crop yields, average rainfall, and other variables. Data preprocessing steps include:

Identifying and handling non-numeric values in the dataset
Removing or processing rows with invalid data entries
Normalizing and transforming data to be used in the model
Exploratory Data Analysis
To understand the dataset and extract meaningful insights, the following analyses were performed:

Graphing Frequency vs Area: Visualizing the distribution of area under cultivation
Yield Per Country: Analyzing crop yields across different countries
Graphing Frequency vs Item: Visualizing the frequency distribution of different crop items
Model Implementation
The decision tree regression model was chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in handling non-linear relationships. The implementation steps include:

Splitting the data into training and testing sets
Training the decision tree regression model on the training data
Evaluating the model's performance on the testing data
Results
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (RÂ²). The results demonstrate the model's ability to accurately predict crop yields, highlighting the importance of key features in the dataset.

Conclusion
This project showcases the potential of decision tree regression in predicting crop yields, providing valuable insights for agricultural planning. Future improvements could include incorporating additional features and exploring other machine learning algorithms for enhanced performance.
